1) You need to create a PathFinder object: PathFinder pf = new PathFinder();

2)	a. For getting optimal path use GetOptimalPath function: pf.GetOptimalPath(table, start_point, end_point);
	   where table is the map (with 1 is blocked way and 0 is free way)
	   required: the function expects to get a matrix of the screen where its sliced into a grid

	b. For using other algorithms use GetPathByAlgorithm function: pf.GetOptimalPath("Astar", table, start_point, end_point);

	This functions will return a list of Point of the path

3) to add a search algorithm go to the Algorithms directory and add a new class implementing ISearcher<Point>, then add it to the dictinary in PathFinder for using it in GetPathByAlgorithm function
